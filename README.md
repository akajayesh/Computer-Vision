# ðŸ§  Computer Vision Projects â€“ Jayesh Sutar

A collection of Python projects built using OpenCV and hand gesture recognition, focused on experimenting with computer vision in real-world interactions.

Originally built to experiment with game control using hand tracking. These scripts showcase different gesture-based tools and systems.



## ðŸš€ Projects Included

- gesture.py â€“ Real-time hand gesture recognition
- gesture_draw.py â€“ Virtual paint application using finger tracking
- gesture_keyboard.py â€“ Control keyboard inputs using hand gestures
- games.py / games2.py â€“ Hand gesture integration with classic browser games
- both.py â€“ Combined setup for game control and drawing with gestures



## ðŸ›  Tech Used (Use this as MediaPipe works on following Python version only!!)

- Python 3.10+
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- PyAutoGUI (for simulating inputs)
- NumPy



## ðŸ’¡ How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python gesture.py
TIP - use :-

python gesture_keyboard.py 

This is optimized and other files are just a check.
